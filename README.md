## Introduction

Rancid Tomatillos is a playful rendition of the popular movie rating site Rotten Tomatoes. We were assigned this paired project in the first week of Mod 3 at [Turing School](turing.edu) and completed full functionality of the project, as well as an additional feature, within 2 weeks. This project was our first time working in the React framework & Router, as well as our first time using Cypress for testing.

When visiting the application, a user is able to click a movie's poster to view more information about the movie. A user is also able to search for a movie by title using the search bar. This information includes an overview, rating, budget, revenue, genres, and a trailer that plays on the page. When viewing the movie's detailed information page, a user is able to navigate back to the home page.
