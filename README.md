## Introduction

Rancid Tomatillos is a playful rendition of the popular movie rating site Rotten Tomatoes. We were assigned this paired project in the first week of Mod 3 at [Turing School](turing.edu) and completed full functionality of the project, as well as an additional feature, within 2 weeks. This project was our first time working in the React framework & Router and helped us to solidify fundamental concepts. We also worked with Cypress testing for the first time in order to test React components & asynchronous JavaScript.

When visiting the application, a user is able to click a movie's poster to view more information about the movie. A user is also able to search for a movie by title using the search bar. This information includes an overview, rating, budget, revenue, genres, and a trailer that plays on the page. When viewing the movie's detailed information page, a user is able to navigate back to the home page.

## Wins
  - Keeping good pacing throughout the project - meeting expectations on deadlines

  - Close attention to User Experience - reflected in the routing and multiple ways to easily return to the main page

## Challenges & Improvements
  - Deciding whether components should be functional or class components
  - Troubleshooting async issues
  - Possible future improvements:
    - Allow a user to search for movies by genre or rating
    - Build our own backend using Express.js
